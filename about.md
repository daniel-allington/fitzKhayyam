Omar Khayyam (1048-1131) was a Persian scientist and poet. Edward FitzGerald (1809-1883) was a British poet. Today, FitzGerald is best known for his loose verse translations of a series of Persian four-line stanzas traditionally attributed to Khayyam. FitzGerald revised his translations and their organisation several times; the fitzKhayyam site attempts to represent the relationships between those stanzas in hypertextual form.

This site was built using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll). The text is that of the WikiSource transcriptions of the [1859](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Rubaiyat_of_Omar_Khayyam_(tr._Fitzgerald,_1st_edition)/The_Rubaiyat_of_Omar_Khayyam), [1868](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Rubaiyat_of_Omar_Khayyam_(tr._Fitzgerald,_2nd_edition)), [1872](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Rubaiyat_of_Omar_Khayyam_(tr._Fitzgerald,_3rd_edition)), [1879](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Rubaiyat_of_Omar_Khayyam_(tr._Fitzgerald,_4th_edition)), and  [1889](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Rubaiyat_of_Omar_Khayyam_(tr._Fitzgerald,_5th_edition)) editions (the last of which was posthumous but based on FitzGerald's notes), from which it was extracted using a Python script. As I created the site for teaching purposes, all the code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/daniel-allington/fitzKhayyam). 

While the intention is eventually to rebuild the site using a text corrected by hand, the first priority is to link together parallel versions of the same stanzas. So far, this has been done for  over half of the stanzas.

Omar Khayyam (1048-1131) was a Persian scientist and poet. Edward FitzGerald (1809-1883) was a British poet. Today, FitzGerald is best known for his loose verse translations of a series of Persian quatrains (four-line stanzas) traditionally attributed to Khayyam. FitzGerald revised his translations and their organisation several times; this site exists to represent the relationships between those stanzas in hypertextual form.

This site was built using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll). The text is that of the WikiSource transcriptions of the [1859](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Rubaiyat_of_Omar_Khayyam_(tr._Fitzgerald,_1st_edition)/The_Rubaiyat_of_Omar_Khayyam), [1868](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Rubaiyat_of_Omar_Khayyam_(tr._Fitzgerald,_2nd_edition)), [1872](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Rubaiyat_of_Omar_Khayyam_(tr._Fitzgerald,_3rd_edition)), [1879](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Rubaiyat_of_Omar_Khayyam_(tr._Fitzgerald,_4th_edition)), and  [1889](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Rubaiyat_of_Omar_Khayyam_(tr._Fitzgerald,_5th_edition)) editions (the last of which was posthumous but based on FitzGerald's notes), from which it was extracted using a Python script.

While the intention is eventually to rebuild it using a text corrected by hand, the first priority is to link together revised versions of the same stanzas (which can't be done numerically, as translations of the same stanza often appear in different places in the running order). So far, this has been done for just over a quarter of the stanzas

Omar Khayyam (1048-1131) was a Persian scientist and poet. Edward FitzGerald (1809-1883) was a British poet. Today, FitzGerald is best known for his loose verse translations of a series of Persian quatrains (four-line stanzas) traditionally attributed to Khayyam. FitzGerald revised his translations and their organisation several times; this site attempts to represent the relationships between those stanzas in hypertextual form.

The site was created for teaching purposes by Daniel Allington, using Jekyll.
